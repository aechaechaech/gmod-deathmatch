# gmod-deathmatch
A deathmatch gamemode, an incredibly original idea

The main gimmick of this is that every 45 seconds everyone gets wall hacks. Theres also Mario Kart styled power ups and a couple of QOL features.

# Install
Make a deathmatch directory in your gamemodes folder and drag and drop everything in there.
